# Eagles-of-the-Rhine-vic2
A mod I'm planning on for Victoria 2 named Eagles of the Rhine. It's based on the divergence point on what if Napoleon III and the Second French Empire won against Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War, along with some other minor and major divergence points (Such as Habsburg Hungary)
